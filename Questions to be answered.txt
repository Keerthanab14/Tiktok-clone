Why are we requiring RecyclerListView?
-This is a high performance listview for React Native
 and Web with support for complex layouts.Loads content as window scrolled,
No frame drops, Highly Performant,Scroll is preserved if data refreshed.
Hence we are using RecyclerListView.

What is the benefit of RLV vs ScrollView?
-Scroll View loads all the data in memory. 
Whereas, RLV only loads data currently in the viewport.
This solves memory problems when rendering large lists.
There is observable frame drops and trouble refreshing data in ScrollView
which is solved in RLV.

What is the benefit of RLV vs FlatList?
- Flat List is the same as Recycler List View when it comes to loading 
only the data currently in the viewport. But the Flat List 
regularly destroys and creates new Views which decreases the performance. 
RLV solves this problem by "recycling" the views and increases the performance.
Scroll position is not preserved if data refreshed and there is observable frame 
drops for large data sets (> 1500).
